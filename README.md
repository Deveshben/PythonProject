1. Go to your Google account dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Security" section.
3. Under "Security," find the "Signing in to Google" option.
4. Enable 2-step verification for added security.
5. After enabling 2-step verification, select "Use an App Password."
6. Follow the steps outlined in Option 2 of this article: [Gmail Less Secure Apps](https://wpmailsmtp.com/gmail-less-secure-apps/).

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Obtain an Excel file containing the recipient information, including email addresses and any other necessary details.
4. Create an HTML email template file that will be used as the body of the email.
5. Update the `config.ini` file with your Gmail account credentials and other necessary configurations.
